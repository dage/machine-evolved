# machine-evolved

A machine learning project to create virtual creatures that can be used in Unreal Engine 4.

This was a massive side project from 2017-2018 where the general idea was to use Bullet physics engine for physics simulations, Unreal Engine 4 for rendering and interactivity, and this project for machine learning to control the virtual creatures by outputting a set of forces to apply to the creature's body parts.

After I stopped working on this, DeepMind and others released a bunch of papers and demos on similar projects, so I'm not sure how much of this is novel anymore, but I want to open source it under the MIT license in case anyone finds it interesting or useful.

The project is poorly documented and quite frankly I don't remember how to reproduce the results, but if you're interested in the code, feel free to poke around and fork it.
