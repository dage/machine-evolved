# machine-evolved

A machine learning project to create virtual creatures that can be used in Unreal Engine 4.

This was a massive side project from 2017-2018 where the general idea was to use Bullet physics engine for physics simulations, Unreal Engine 4 for rendering and interactivity, and this project for machine learning to control the virtual creatures by outputting a set of forces to apply to the creature's body parts.

After I stopped working on this, DeepMind and others released a bunch of papers and demos on similar projects, so I'm not sure how much of this is novel anymore, but I want to open source it under the MIT license in case anyone finds it interesting or useful and want to do something with it.

The project is poorly documented and quite frankly I don't remember how to reproduce the results, but I did find a video from my Snapchat My Story history that demonstrates what the system is capable of so I'm including it here as a quick reference (please ignore the Norwegian text ðŸ˜…):
